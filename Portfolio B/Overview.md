# Overview

#### The client and key problem
The Museum of Bristol (the main stakeholder) possesses a vast number of notes recording the observation of various species that can help further study on the effect on climate change. However, the time-consuming on manually transcribing texts and the difficulties of recognising the handwriting could potentially increase significant labour and money. Therefore, an application facilitating the process ofÂ analysing the notes is in demand of the stakeholder.

#### Our product vision
Overall, the ultimate goal of the project is a web-based, open-source interface to transcribe images to text, and optimise the precision by training data itself. The extracted text should then be analysed by a Natural Language Processing module to help to extract some basic information from the text. The application should be capable either to generate a transcript from the notes, and to provide a web interface for accessing these notes. In addition, a considerable level of user interface should be implemented to guide the users and improve experience.

#### Our product outcome
Due to the outbreak of the virus (see detailed explanation in COVID-19 Statement ), instead of completely fulfilling the goals, the group had made best attempts to meet the demands of the ultimate goals. The submitted application is able to extract text information from a given image with a reasonably clear handwriting. Also, the application supports loading and storing from/to the cloud storage. Finally, the user interface like login/logout system, gallery preview, drag and drop previewing and uploading interface were implemented.
