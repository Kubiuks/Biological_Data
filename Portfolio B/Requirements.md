### Non-Functional Requirements 

#### Usability Requirements

In order to improve the "user experience" for people visiting the web app,
we had to consider issues relating to ease of access and use of the website.
Here are most important principles our design should follow:

1. Errors should be prevented wherever possible. If the user still encounters
an error, there should be help provided to deal with the error.
2. Design should be intuitive and minimalistic, the user should not have to
think what they have to do to achieve their goal. The path leading to their
goal should be straightforward.
3. Design should follow prevalent solutions to common problems. The user
should not have to learn how our design works, instead he should be familiar
with it from other sources.

#### Security Requirements

1. Communication should take place over secure https channels
2. Access to Database, Storage and Text Extract must be admin-only
3. Sensitive data should be stored only in the cloud, so the breach is unlikely
4. The web app should have a SSL certificate, to be recognised as a real website

#### Accessibility Requirements

1. After deployment, the web app should be available for everyone on the 
internet.
2. The web app should be friendly to disabled visitors.
